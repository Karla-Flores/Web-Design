<h1>Web-Design--Challenge</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p align = 'justify'>In building this <a href = 'https://karla-flores.github.io/Web-Design--Challenge/'> dashboard, </a> we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.</p>
<br>
<h3>Website Requirements</h3>
<p align = 'justify'>For reference, see the "Screenshots" <a href = 'https://github.com/Karla-Flores/Web-Design--Challenge/tree/main/WebVisualizations'>here.</a> The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:</p>
<p align = 'justify'>
<ul>
  <li>A landing page containing: An explanation of the project. Links to each visualizations page.</li>
  <li>Four visualization pages, each with: A descriptive title and heading tag. The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison. A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.</li>
  <li>A "Comparisons" page that: Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them. Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations. The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.</li>
  <li>A "Data" page that: Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. The table must be a bootstrap table component</li>
</ul>
