<h1>Web-Design--Challenge</h1>

<br>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align = 'justify'>In building this <a href = 'https://karla-flores.github.io/Web-Design--Challenge/'> dashboard, </a> we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.</p>
<br>
<h3>Website Requirements</h3>
<p align = 'justify'>For reference, see the "Screenshots" <a href = 'https://github.com/Karla-Flores/Web-Design--Challenge/tree/main/WebVisualizations'>here.</a> The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:</p>
<p align = 'justify'>
<ul>
  <li>A landing page containing: An explanation of the project, which links to each visualizations page.</li>
  <li>Four visualization pages, each web has a descriptive title and heading tag. The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison and a paragraph that describes the plot and its significance.</li>
  <li>A "Comparisons" page contains all of the visualizations on the same page to easily visually compare them. This web uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.</li>
  <li>A "Data" page displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. The table must be a bootstrap table component.</li>
</ul>
