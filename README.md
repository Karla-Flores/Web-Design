<h3>Background</h3>
In building this <a href = 'https://karla-flores.github.io/Web-Design--Challenge/'> dashboard </a>, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
